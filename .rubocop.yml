# The magic comment is at the top. Below the top is the bloody licenses, having
# a space in between looks like shit. The motivation of this style rule is so
# you don't glue actual code comments to the magic comment, we don't do that
# as we use a freeer license than most of Ruby code and need a licenses header
# to properly license!

# Style suggestion is to use activesupport to be able to indent heredocs. I say
# fuck this suggestion. I am not going to require some stupid gem to be able to
# indent heredocs. Ruby 2.3 will solve this with <<~ heredocs.
